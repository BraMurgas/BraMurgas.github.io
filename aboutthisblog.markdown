I wanted to write a blog since 2018 and share the results of some projects I was working on with some friends from Colombia. It's march 2020 so I had enough time to think about the tools, platforms and style I wanted to used. 

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can find the source code for [Minima at GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and the source code for [Jekyll at GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). 

I appreciate to read other peoples blogs. In one of them I found some interesting information about making web-sites more eco-friendly, take a look at this resources :

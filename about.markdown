I'm a PhD student in materials science at [Cemef](https://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/en/homepage/) (Nice, France) in the MSR(Metallurgy, Structure and Reology)/MSM(Multiscale Modelling) group with the founding of an [ANR](https://anr.fr/fr/) industrial chair [Digimu](https://chaire-digimu.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/). My PhD project is the "Analysis and modelling of grain boundary mobility". My researh aims to describe the parameters affecting grain boundary mobility, answer purely metallurgical questions and implement it in a Finite Element Method code. Everything based on comparisons with experimental data.

Beside materials science I'm interested in  astronomy, open software, open science, reproducible science, image processing, video creation, scientific visualization, photography and illustration.

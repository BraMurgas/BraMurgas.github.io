I'm a postdoctoral research associate in materials science and computational mechanics at [XCP-5](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/xcp/xcp-5). I am working in two projects focused on grain boundary-dislocation interactions. I am developing new models and formulations that consider grain boundary-dislocation interactions using Phase Field and Crystal Plasticity with Continuum Dislocation Transport.

I did my PhD at [Cemef](https://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/en/homepage/) (Nice, France) in the MSR(Metallurgy, Structure and Reology)/MSM(Multiscale Modelling) group with the founding of an [ANR](https://anr.fr/fr/) industrial chair [Digimu](https://chaire-digimu.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/). My PhD project was the "Analysis and modelling of grain boundary mobility". My research aims to describe the parameters affecting grain boundary mobility, answer purely metallurgical questions and implement it in an in-house Finite Element library. Everything based on comparisons with experimental data.

Beside materials science I'm interested in  astronomy, open software, open science, reproducible science, image processing, video creation, scientific visualization, photography and illustration.

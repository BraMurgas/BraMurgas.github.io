I'm a postdoctoral fellow in materials science and computational mechanics at [cmrl](https://cmrl.jhu.edu/). I am working in two projects focused on the Failure and Fatigue Analysis of Cold Sprayed and Additive Manufactured Materials. The main difficulties of this project are the generation of exotic synthetic microstructures produced during this new manufacturing process, and upscaling the mechanical response to macroscopic samples. 

I did my PhD at [Cemef](https://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/en/homepage/) (Nice, France) in the MSR(Metallurgy, Structure and Reology)/MSM(Multiscale Modelling) group with the founding of an [ANR](https://anr.fr/fr/) industrial chair [Digimu](https://chaire-digimu.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/). My PhD project was the "Analysis and modelling of grain boundary mobility". My research aims to describe the parameters affecting grain boundary mobility, answer purely metallurgical questions and implement it in an in-house Finite Element library. Everything based on comparisons with experimental data.

Beside materials science I'm interested in  astronomy, open software, open science, reproducible science, image processing, video creation, scientific visualization, photography and illustration.

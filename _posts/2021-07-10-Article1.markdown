I just published my first article as first author in Materials journal from MDPI. Comparative Study and Limits of Different Level-Set Formulations for the Modeling of Anisotropic Grain Growth you can follow this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/14/14/3883) and read it. If you have questions or want to discuss with me about the article please send me an email.

Author: Brayan David Murgas Portilla. This art work have been shown for the first time during the World Congress of Computational Mechanics (WCCM-ECCOMAS) that took place on january 11-15, 2021. And has been developed at [Cemef](https://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr/en/homepage/).

The origin of this image began when I started my PhD at CEMEF.

I received his laptop and was looking for a wallpaper. I came up with the idea to do it by myself with the images I obtained from my first simulations. 

To improve the Finite Elements modes, I use Scanning Electron Microscopes allowing to properly describe grain boundaries.

The images used here represent the steps to immerse EBSD data into a Finite Element code: the Band contrast map which is an EBSD pattern that describes the average intensity of the Kikuchi bands.

The kikuchi bands are formed by electron scattering and describes the orientation of every pixel which is represented in the form of an inverse pole figure in the second slice of the image.

Finally I use the orientation data of every pixel to construct the three last slices of the image: distance, orientation and grain boundary mobility fields.

With this methodology I can directly compare my results to experimental data and also I replace in-situ experiments which are time consuming and difficult to perform.

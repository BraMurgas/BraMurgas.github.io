I'm a bike enthusiast. Here are some of the videos and pictures I've done while biking with some colleagues. Most of the clips were recorded in Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur (PACA) Region: [Route clips on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhSHFJ_41Anxe8az6AFH2sPilKekbfL6P) and [Instagram photos](https://www.instagram.com/brayandmurgas/).
